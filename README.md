# TFGFarmacia
This is my Final Degree Project.

I have chosen to develop my pharmacy management application using Angular on the client side and Django on the server side, with MySQL as the database. Additionally, I would like to highlight that the entire project has been developed in a Docker container with all the necessary requirements for the proper functioning of the project.
